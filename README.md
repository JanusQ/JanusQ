# JanusQ
A Software Framework for Analyzing, Optimizing, and Implementing Quantum Circuit.

## Installation
For Linux:  
- Python: version >= 3.10
  - In shell, 'python --version' views the python version.
```shell
pip install janusq.whl
# or you can pull source code directly from github.
git clone git@github.com:JanusQ/JanusQ.git
cd JanusQ
pip install -r requirements.txt




# or you can directly pull docker image from docker hub.
docker pull janusq:janusq:latest
```

## Structure of the Framework
- JanusCT
  - vectorization
    - janusq/analysis/vectorization.py: This python script holds code related to the generation of path table and the vecterization of circuits
  - fidelity preidiction
    - janusq/analysis/fidelity_prediction.py: This python script holds code related to training a model and using it to predict the fidelity of a circuit.
  - fidelity optimization
    -  janusq/optimizations/mapping/mapping_ct.pyï¼šThis python script holds code related to a typical compilation flow includes routing and scheduling. The routing pass transforms the circuit to satisfy the processor topology.
  - unitary decomposition
    - janusq/analysis/unitary_decompostion.py: This python script holds code related to takes a unitary as input and decomposes it into matrices of basic gates, resulting in an equivalent circuit.
  - bug identification
    - identify the potential bugs in the quantum algorithm implementation.
- JanusFEM
  - benchmarking.py. Generate a circuit for measuring calibration matrices.
  - mitigation.py. Implement iterative calibration, which includes quantifying interactions between qubits and constructing Bayesian networks.
  - tools.py. Implement data format conversion.
- HyQSAT
  - hyqsat/common: This dir stores common functions about cnf files, such as readCNF.
  - hyqsat/solveSatBy**.py: The main python function; use to solve sat problem.
- time crystal
