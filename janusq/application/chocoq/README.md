# Choco

## Installation

You can install the virtual environment in two version, The CPU version is for simulation quantum circuit with CPU and the GPU version simulate quantum circuit by GPU.

### CPU version
1. Install the envirnoment by conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment_cpu.yml
```
2. activate the installed virtual environment.
```bash
conda activate chocoq_cpu
```
If the installation is interrupted or fails, you need to delete the environment and reinstall: 
```bash
conda remove -n chocoq_cpu --all
```
3. install chocoq
```bash
pip install .
```


### GPU version （need the support of CUDA12）
1. Install the envirnoment by conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment_gpu.yml
```
2. activate the installed virtual environment.
```bash
conda activate choco_gpu
```
If the nextwork is poor, the installation time for GPU will be longer, please be patient.
When the installation is interrupted or fails, you need to delete the environment and reinstall: 
```bash
conda remove -n choco_gpu --all
```
3. install chocoq
```bash
pip install .
```



## Test for installation
Run corresponding test files according to the installation version:

```bash
python testbed_cpu.py
```
for CPU version or 
```bash
python testbed_gpu.py
```
for GPU version.

If you see "Environment configuration is successful!" it means the installation is successful.

If the installation fails, you may consider:

1. Ensure that the correct conda environment is activated in the terminal.
2. After switching environments, execute `pip install .` under `Choco-Q/` to install the chocoq package.
3. Make sure the Python execution environment is set to the corresponding conda environment. you may disable the user site by 
```bash
 export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
```
